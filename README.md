A Mario Bros inspired video game but using Homer Simpon in Springfield.
This project was developed as part of my Programming Fundamentals 1 course at [USI](https://www.usi.ch/it?_gl=1%2Agbvona%2A_ga%2AMTE2NTUzMjM1Ny4xNzA3NDEwNzE1%2A_ga_89Y0EEKVWP%2AMTcwOTgyOTY3NS41LjEuMTcwOTgyOTc2MC42MC4wLjE1MDQ4MDcwNDg.)


## Project Purpose üéØ
Super Mario Bros is one of the most influential games of all time. The Simpsons is one of the most influential TV series of all time. Together they make the perfect combo and an amazingly fun videogame.


## Important Features ‚ú®  
All the Racket files and the maps (images) are contained in the "GAME-FILES" folder. The Homer Simpson character was completely developed in Racket while the maps are images. In file [Images.rkt] are contained all images features. Roads and Donuts are parts of the background image (map), for which posns had been taken to have floors on which homer would have walked on. The goal is to make Homer arrive to Moe's bar, the end of the map without falling. You can jump on donuts and Power Reactors. Moe's bar and Homer's house are parts of the background image (map). Dollars and Skateboards, respectively, increase and decrease the score counter.
