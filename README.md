## Project Features
All the Racket files and the maps (images) are contained in the "GAME-FILES" folder. The Homer Simpson character was completely developed in Racket while the maps are images. In file [Images.rkt] are contained all images features. Roads and Donuts are parts of the background image (map), for which posns had been taken to have floors on which homer would have walked on. The goal is to make Homer arrive to Moe's bar, the end of the map without falling. You can jump on donuts and Power Reactors. Moe's bar and Homer house are parts of the background image (map). Dollars and Skateboards respectively increase and decrease the score counter.
